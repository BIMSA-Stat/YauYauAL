\title{Generate a Grid of All Combinations of Input Sequence}
\usage{
ExpandGrid(Dim, s)
}
\arguments{
\item{Dim}{Integer. The number of dimensions for the grid. For example, \code{Dim = 2} creates a 2D grid.}

\item{s}{A numeric vector (\code{NumericVector}) containing the values to expand into the grid.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix (\code{NumericMatrix}) where each row represents a combination of values from
\code{s} across \code{Dim} dimensions.
rows and \code{Dim} columns.
}
\description{
This function generates a grid by expanding the input sequence \code{s} across the specified
number of dimensions (\code{Dim}). The resulting grid contains all possible combinations of the
elements in \code{s}, repeated across \code{Dim} dimensions. The grid is filled column by column,
with the last column cycling through the values in \code{s} the fastest.
}
\details{
This function creates a numeric matrix where each row represents a unique combination of the elements
in \code{s} distributed across \code{Dim} dimensions. The total number of rows in the resulting matrix
is \eqn{\text{length}(s)^\text{Dim}}, and the number of columns is equal to \code{Dim}.
The combinations are generated such that the first column cycles through all combinations the slowest,
while the last column cycles the fastest.

\examples{
# Generate a 3D grid using values from 1 to 4
s <- seq(1, 4, 1)
Dim <- 3
grid <- ExpandGrid(Dim, s)
print(grid)
